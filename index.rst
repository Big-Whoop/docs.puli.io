Puli_ (pronounced "poo-lee") is a PHP tool that enables you to create Plug 'n
Play packages for Composer_. These packages are completely independent of any
PHP framework. Use them with your favorite framework or without. The choice is
yours.

Resources?
----------

*Resources*, in Puli's language, are all files that are not PHP, such as XML,
YAML, CSS, JavaScript, images and so on. What PHP's autoloader is to your PHP
code, Puli is to any other file.

How does it work?
-----------------

Puli puts a ``puli.json`` file into each Puli-enabled package. This file
contains metadata about the resources of the package and can be edited through
Puli's Command Line Interface (CLI). Your PHP code loads Puli resources through
the Puli Components.

Features
--------

.. topic:: Automatic Resource Discovery

    With Puli, your installed Composer packages recognize each other
    automatically. You no longer need to configure packages to find each other's
    files. Puli does it for you.

.. topic:: Load Resources Anywhere

    Puli provides a framework-agnostic naming convention to access files in
    Composer packages. With this convention, you can easily load files from any
    installed package. Independent of your framework.

.. topic:: Publish Package Resources

    Puli publishes your package's public resources, such as CSS files or images,
    to your web server and generates their URLs for you. Want to serve images
    from a Content Delivery Network? You can do it.

.. topic:: Override Package Resources

    With Puli, you can easily override files in other Composer packages. Want to
    customize a HTML, CSS or a configuration file? With Puli, all you need is to
    call a simple console command.
